# bijux-vex philosophy

- bijux-vex is a **vector execution engine**, not a database.
- Contracts (deterministic vs non-deterministic) are first-class and enforced.
- Execution artifacts are replayable evidence, not storage indexes.
- Approximation is explicit, auditable, and comparable against exact runs.
- Backends are interchangeable execution substrates that must declare capabilities and refuse incompatible contracts.
