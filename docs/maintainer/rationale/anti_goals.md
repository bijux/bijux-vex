# bijux-vex anti-goals

- Not a vector database or key-value store.
- Not an embedding or model inference framework.
- Not a RAG orchestration system.
- Not a generic serving layer or SLA manager.
- Not a benchmark suite; comparisons exist to validate contracts, not to market performance.

Every new feature must demonstrate how it strengthens vector execution contracts or auditability. If it drifts toward these anti-goals, it should be rejected.
