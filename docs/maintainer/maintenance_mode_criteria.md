# Maintenance-mode criteria (future)

Do not declare maintenance-only until:
- at least one stable public release cycle (v0.1.x → v0.2.x) with migration experience.
- documented external adopters and integrations.
- no pending contract changes or experimental ND features.
- governance decision recorded in design_diary and freeze_criteria.

Until then: bijux-vex is contract-complete and open to empirical refinement.
