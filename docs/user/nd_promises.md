# What ND Can and Cannot Promise

## Why this exists

ND is powerful but only safe when its limits are explicit. This page exists to set expectations before you rely on ND in production.

## What ND optimizes for

- Speed at scale
- Bounded quality with explicit metrics
- Transparent uncertainty

## What ND cannot guarantee

- Bit‑identical replay
- Exact ranking agreement with deterministic search
- Stability without fixed index hashes and parameters

## What replaces guarantees

- Quality metrics (instability, margin, entropy)
- Witness checks when enabled
- Declared randomness profiles and bounds
