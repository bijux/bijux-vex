# ND Examples With Interpretation

## Example: Safe ND run

- This run is safe because instability is low and margins are clear.
- Confidence is high, and witness confirms overlap.

## Example: Risky ND run

- This run is risky because instability is high and margins are thin.
- Confidence is low; use witness or switch to deterministic.

## Example: Refusal

- This run refused because the budget was too tight for the requested recall.
- Increase the budget or lower the recall target.
