# Who Should Use This

Good fit

- Infra engineers who need reproducible search behavior.
- ML platform teams who need auditability.
- Compliance‑sensitive orgs that must explain results.

Not a fit

- Teams looking for a managed vector DB.
- Teams wanting an end‑to‑end RAG framework.
- Teams that prefer implicit convenience over explicit guarantees.
