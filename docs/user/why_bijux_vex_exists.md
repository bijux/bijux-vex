# Why Bijux‑Vex Exists

Vector search in production often fails silently. Rankings drift, audits don’t replay, and teams can’t explain why results changed. Most systems optimize for convenience, not correctness.

Bijux‑Vex exists to protect you from that silence. It makes determinism explicit, makes ND bounded, and refuses execution when guarantees are not met.

Refusals are not obstacles—they are the system telling you the truth early.
