# ND Starts With Use Cases

ND is not a warning label. It is how you make large‑scale retrieval practical.

Use cases

- Search at scale (when exact is too slow)
- Recommendations (when small ranking drift is acceptable)
- Clustering and similarity exploration
- RAG retrieval (fast candidate generation)
- Anomaly detection (approximate neighbors at scale)

ND is safe when its bounds are explicit and monitored.
