Bijux-Vex exists because **correctness breaks quietly** in real systems. A search result that changes between runs can trigger wrong decisions, broken audits, or production incidents that take weeks to explain. Bijux-Vex protects you from that kind of invisible drift.

The system chooses **correctness over convenience** on purpose. It refuses to guess, refuses to hide uncertainty, and refuses to pretend that approximation is exact. This is not stubbornness—it is a safety feature. If you need a clear audit trail or you need to know when your results can be trusted, you want a system that says “no” at the right time.

Refusals exist because silence is dangerous. When a backend can’t meet the contract, a refusal makes the problem visible immediately—before it becomes a costly incident. ND (non-deterministic) execution is treated carefully for the same reason: it is powerful, but only safe when its limits are explicit.

If you want a system that **tells the truth about its guarantees**, Bijux-Vex is for you.
