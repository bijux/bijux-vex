# Start here — bijux-vex onboarding

## What problem does bijux-vex solve?
Vector execution often hides determinism assumptions. bijux-vex makes execution contracts explicit, auditable, and replayable so you can compare deterministic (exact) and non-deterministic (ANN) runs side by side.

## When should you use it?
- You need reproducible deterministic vector execution with provenance you can replay.
- You want bounded, auditable non-deterministic execution (ANN) with explicit approximation and randomness metadata.
- You care about comparing exact vs approximate results across backends and artifacts.

## Deterministic vs non-deterministic (high level)
- Deterministic: exact search, bit-stable, replay required. No hidden randomness.
- Non-deterministic (ANN, experimental): approximate path only, bounded divergence, emits `ApproximationReport` + `RandomnessProfile`, replay is envelope-based.
