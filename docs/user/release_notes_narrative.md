# Release Narrative (v0.2, draft)

v0.2 turns Bijux‑Vex into a system you can trust in production. It formalizes deterministic replay, makes ND bounded and auditable, and pushes “nothing implicit” deeper into the CLI, API, and provenance.

Compared to v0.1, v0.2 is not just more features—it is more explicit. It tells you when a guarantee is real, when it is bounded, and when it cannot be met.
