# Freeze Meanings (Not Code)

These meanings are stable even if implementations evolve:

- Deterministic execution = exact, replayable, auditable.
- ND execution = approximate, bounded, explicitly declared.
- Refusal = the system cannot meet the requested guarantee.
- Provenance = structured evidence of what happened and why.
