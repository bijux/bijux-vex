# Determinism by Analogy

Determinism is like a scientific experiment: if you can’t reproduce the results, you don’t know if the result is real.

It’s also like accounting: an audit only works if the numbers can be traced back to the original ledger.

Replay is your verification step. It is how you prove that a result is not a fluke or a hidden change.
