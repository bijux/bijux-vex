# Stability Markers

Stable

- Deterministic execution and replay
- Provenance schema
- CLI core commands

Experimental

- ND runners and ANN behavior
- ND tuning and witness verification
- Remote vector store integrations

Frozen vs evolving

- Frozen: execution contracts, query contract, provenance fields
- Evolving: ND quality metrics and tuning heuristics
