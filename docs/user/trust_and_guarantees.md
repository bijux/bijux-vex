# Trust & Guarantees

Hard guarantees

- Deterministic execution is exact and replayable.
- Canonical ordering applies to deterministic results.
- Provenance is emitted for every execution.

Bounded guarantees

- ND quality is bounded by explicit metrics.
- ND replay is possible only within declared bounds.

Explicit non‑guarantees

- Cross‑backend numeric equality beyond the query contract.
- Implicit fallbacks or hidden approximation.
- “Best effort” determinism.
