Keep the process boring and predictable.

## Ground rules
- Determinism and provenance are non-negotiable; never weaken invariants.
- All changes must pass `make lint quality security test`.
- Public surfaces (`cli`, `api/v1`, core types) require tests and doc updates.
- Do not merge with a dirty worktree or failing CI.

## Workflow
1) Fork/branch from `main`.
2) Add a towncrier fragment in `changelog.d/` (`feature`, `bugfix`, `internal`).
3) Implement code + tests + docs together.
4) Run the full gate: `make lint quality security test`.
5) Open a PR with a concise description and link to relevant docs/specs.

## Commit/tag hygiene
- Versions are derived from git tags via `hatch-vcs`; never hard-code.
- Breaking changes require explicit ABI/public API version bumps and doc updates.
- Licensing: code is MIT, docs/config CC0; see `docs/legal/licensing.md`.

## Questions
File an issue or start a discussion on GitHub. Be explicit about contracts and invariants you’re touching.
